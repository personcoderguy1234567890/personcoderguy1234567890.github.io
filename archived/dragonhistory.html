    <h1>The History of Dragons</h1>
    <p class="wtext">Many Many melleniums ago there lived the most magical beasts to have ever have roamed the earth. The Dragons were of five main elements rock type minerals, fire, water, air, and plants. In the early days dragons and humans would work together to create great accomplishments like the pyramids of Egypt, the temples of the Aztecs and democracy of the Ancient Greeks. But as technology grew, humans felt there was no need for dragons. The leaders of the earths 10 nations gathered to put an end to the dragons. The Dragons found out and decided to attack first. The war had put tarnish to the land. In the end the Dragon Elders thought it would be wise to leave earth and go back home after seeing the destruction that had occured. The Dragons disappeared the same way they came yet some dragons loved earth too much and thought the war would come to an end, other's stayed for revenge. The war had left no trace of the existance of Dragons and restarted history to be what we believe it to be today.</p>
