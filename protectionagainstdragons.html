    <h1>Dancing Abilities</h1>
    
    <p class="wtext">Despite the heated debate research suggests that dragons love dancing. It distracts and hynotises them and they can even fall in love with you. It is still unclear as to what dances it like the most.</p>

    <h1>Weapons and Armour</h1>
    
    <p class="wtext">When you see a dragon it's good to be packing. I'm talking about all out military grade, super nova, instant boom boom explosions. If you think you can out run a dragon you don't stand a chance. Aim for the head as enough damage there can cause the dragon to lose it's coordination. Other parts of the dragon have quick healing abilities that will almost instantly heal. Here are a few of my recommendations for supplies </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li class="wtext">Armoured Vehicle</li>

        <p class="height">You must take to the skies and land to defeat a full grown healthy dragon. And then the seas if applicable.</p>
