    <h1>Weapons</h1>
    
    <p>When you see a dragon it's good to be packing. I'm talking about all out military grade, super nova, instant boom boom explosions. If you think you can out run a dragon you don't stand a chance. Aim for the head as enough damage there can cause the dragon to lose it's coordination. Other parts of the dragon have quick healing abilities that will almost instantly heal. Here are a few of my recommendations for supplies </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Rocket Launcher</li>
